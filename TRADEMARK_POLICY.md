# StatLine™ Trademark Policy

**Trademark Registration Status**  
“StatLine” and associated logos are trademarks of StatLine LLC (in formation), 
registration pending. Trademark rights are protected under common law and, upon 
approval, under federal trademark law.

---

## 1. Permitted Uses
You may use the StatLine name or logo only in the following ways:
- To accurately refer to the original StatLine project.
- In academic, journalistic, or educational discussion of the project.
- To state “Powered by StatLine” **only** if your deployment uses the official, 
unmodified scoring algorithms and data models provided by StatLine.

Such uses must be accurate, not misleading, and must not suggest sponsorship, 
endorsement, or affiliation by StatLine LLC unless expressly authorized.

---

## 2. Restricted Uses
You may **not**:
- Use “StatLine” or any confusingly similar name (e.g. “StatLyne,” “StatLineX”) 
for your own product, service, or fork without written permission.
- Use the StatLine logo, trade dress, or branding elements in a way that suggests 
your project is the official StatLine.
- Continue using the StatLine name or branding in derivative works. Any fork or 
modification must adopt a distinct name and identity unless explicitly authorized 
by StatLine LLC.

## 3. Contributions
- Improvements to StatLine should be submitted as contributions via pull request 
or approved collaboration channels.
- By contributing, you agree that your contributions become part of the StatLine 
project under its license and do not give you rights to the StatLine mark.

## 4. Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in legal action. StatLine LLC actively 
enforces its trademark rights to protect the integrity of the project and 
avoid confusion between official and unofficial versions.
